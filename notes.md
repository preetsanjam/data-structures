## Notes

- In-built data structures in Python:
    - List
    - Tuple
    - Set
    - Dictionary

- **List:** 
    - We can store different data types in a list.
    - A list and an array are not the same because an array supports just a single data type. An array is a collection of homogeneous elements.

- **Tuple:**
    - A tuple is immutable. It means elements cannot be added to a tuple once it is created. It cannot be changed.
